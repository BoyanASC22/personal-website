                I am currently a rising-senior in the High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies (HSDLAS). In HSDLAS, there are numerous Asian cultures that you can experience. HSDLAS, being at the center of Chinatown, allows students to immerse themselves within Chinese culture and learn Mandarin alongside native speakers. I have met so many wonderful friends there, most of them being from the Compass Summer Program. I have a big friend group that comes from HSDLAS' Model United Nations Club.

                I am currently the vice president of instruction and historian of my school's Model United Nations club. From the start of my junior year, they have been the best friend group I could ask for. They have taught me the basics of Model United Nations and encouraged me to build up my public speaking skills and leadership skills. Within HSDLASMUN, I have participated in numerous international conferences such as HarvardMUN and NHSMUN, as well as some local conferences such as StuyMUN. For the upcoming future, we plan on joining the UChicago MUN Conference, as well as the Horace Mann School MUN Conference (a private school). Finally, I currently have two personal awards, them being the Award of Distinction from NHSMUN as well as being nominated as one of the best high school delegates in BestDelegateMUN, as well as club awards such as best MUN club, etc.
